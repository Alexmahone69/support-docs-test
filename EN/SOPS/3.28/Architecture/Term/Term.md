# Terms and Definitions

| Terminology | Explanation |
| --- | -- |
| Components |In the BlueKing system, we call every third-party interface connected to APIGateway (Enterprise Service Bus) a component. |
|  Standard Plugin  | Standard operation and maintenance will perform secondary packaging according to the business logic of each API component, adding rich form interfaces and verification logic. We call these standard plug-ins, or plug-ins for short. It can be a script execution of a job platform, an interface call of a certain service, or a timer, etc. |
| Node |A process unit in standard operation and maintenance, including process control nodes and task nodes. When executing tasks, each node will have the status of not executing, executing, executing successfully, and executing failed. |
|  Flow Control Node  | A type of node in standard operation and maintenance, which does not contain specific execution logic itself, but is only used to control the execution process of the task process. For example, the start node identifies the start of the task process, and the gateway node controls the start and end of the parallel process and branch process. |
|Gateway nodes |Include parallel gateways, branch gateways and convergence gateways, used to control the start and end of parallel and branch processes. |
| Parallel Gateway |It is used to identify the start of a parallel process. By pairing with the aggregation gateway, it can control multiple nodes to execute in parallel. |
| Exclusive Gateway  |It is used to identify the start of the branch process. By pairing with the aggregation gateway, it can dynamically control the execution of one of the multiple branches according to the calculation result of the branch expression. |
|  Converge Gateway | is used to mark the end of a parallel process or a branch process. Please note that in standard operation and maintenance, a parallel process can be embedded in a branch process, and a branch process can also be embedded in a parallel process. Please ensure that the convergence gateway and parallel gateway or branch The gateways correspond one-to-one, and there cannot be cross-embedding or mismatching. |
| Task node|Task node is the specific execution logic unit of standard operation and maintenance, including standard plug-in nodes and sub-process nodes. Each task node includes basic information, input parameters and output parameters. The input parameters and output parameters can be used to check and generate Global variables, input parameters can also refer to global variables to simplify user input. |
| Standard Plugin Node  |The smallest execution unit in standard operation and maintenance, which needs to refer to the standard plug-in provided by standard operation and maintenance, which means that when creating a task through the process template, the selected standard plug-in will be executed once. |
|  Subflow Node  |Through  Subflow Node , users can realize the reuse of process templates. In general, users can create multiple process templates, each with relatively simple functions, and then refer to the previously created simple process templates as sub-processes in the newly created process templates to form a new process template with complex logic. |
| Sequence flow | Sequence flow is a directed line segment used to connect two nodes in standard operation and maintenance, and identifies the execution direction of the task process. |
| Process/process template | In standard operation and maintenance, the set of operations in each basic operation and maintenance scenario is a process, and the process is a template for creating tasks. |
| Task/Task Instance | In standard operation and maintenance, we can create a task according to a process, each task is a real business scenario operation, and the task can be suspended or forcibly terminated. |
| Global variables |Global variables are public parameters of a process template, and are uniquely constrained by KEY. Users can refer to the input parameters of task nodes and branch gateway expressions, and the standard operation and maintenance will automatically replace the references of global variables with the values of global variables when executing tasks. |
|  Mini-App |In order to do more fine-grained authority control, we have added a  Mini-App . You can create a  Mini-App  through a process template and authorize the relevant personnel to execute it. The  Mini-App  will automatically appear in the Blueking work of the relevant personnel On the stage, because the standard operation and maintenance task interface is simple enough, even if this person does not understand technology, he can perform the task. |
